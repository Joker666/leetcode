## Two Pointer

Two pointer is a technique where there are two pointers pointing
to two different indices in an array of two different nodes in a linked list.

Usually both pointers move based on some condition.
There's two variations of two pointers technique.

- Opposite directional
- Equi directional

Finding out the right conditional under which a pointer will move forward
is the real challenge. And when to stop.
