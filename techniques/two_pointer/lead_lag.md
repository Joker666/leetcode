# Lead Lag

Two pointers pointing to two different nodes in either a linked list or an array.
While traversing, the parallel distance is kept the same.

That means the speed at which each pointer is moving is the same.
This way, the initial distance between then is kept intact.

Useful:

- If an operation needs to be done in two steps.
- Maintain access to nodes that have been traversed already.
